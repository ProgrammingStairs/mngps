Programming Language : 
----------------------
It is a set of Instructions, commands and other syntaxes used to create a software.

Programming Language can be classified as : 

            Programming Language

   Language

(0 , 1 
true , false 
on , off)

Binary Language : 
-----------------
Advantages : 
i. Instructions are given in the form of 0's and 1's 
ii. Processing speed is fast 
iii. Execution time is less 
iv. Example : Machine Language

Disadvantages : 
i. Programmers are not able to memorize code.
ii. Updation is difficult 
iii. Debugging is also difficult 
     (Bug means error and Debugging means to resolve that error)
iv. Time Consuming

Assembly Language :
-------------------
Advantage :
i. Instructions are given in alpha numeric symbols (Mnemonic code)
   ADD for Addition
   SUB for Subtraction 
   MOVE for moving data
   CPY, CMP etc
ii. It is mainly used in Processors
iii. Here we use Assembler as a translator.
     Assembler translates your assembly language code into binary code | machine code 

Disadvantage : 
i. It is not a portable language
ii. Machine dependent
iii. Here one line of assembly language is going to be converted into multiple lines of machine code.

ADD a,b    101010101
           000010101
           101010101
           010101110
iv. Time consuming

--------------------------------
High Level programming language : 
--------------------------------
i. It is a portable language 
ii. Its machine independent
iii. Instructions are given in english like statement
iv. Updation and debugging is simpler as compared to above two programming language.
v. Here we use compiler and interpreter as a translator.
vi. Example : Java, Php, Python, .Net etc

Compiler : 
---------
i. Compiler compiles whole code at a time and generates a list of error if any
ii. Processing speed is fast
iii. Execution time is less
iv. once compiled and run it multiple times

Interpreter : 
-----------
i. Interpreter interpretes code line by line
ii. Processing speed is slow
iii. Execution time is more  
iv. Before run we needs to interpret code every time whether we do changes in the code or not.

Tokens in C Language
--------------------
Token : Token is the smallest unit of information
Token includes : 
   1. Constant 
   2. Variable 
   3. Keyword 
   4. Identifiers
   5. Seperators 
   6. Operators

1. Constant :
Constant is an entity whose value cannot be changed during the execution of program. 

Ways to define a constant : 
   There are two ways to define a constant : 
      a. By const keyword 
            const double PI = 3.14;

      b. By #define preprocessor
            #define PI 3.14 

Types of Constant : 
   There are 3 types of constant : 
      a. Integer Constant  
         i. Contains atleast one digit . Ex : 7,2,3 etc
         ii. It may be positive or negative . Ex : -4,2 etc 
         iii. By default it is considered as positive . Ex : 8 
         iv. Decimal part is absent. Ex : 9,2,43 etc
      
      b. Real Constant  
         i. Contains atleast one digit . Ex : 7.4,2.3,3.33 etc
         ii. It may be positive or negative . Ex : -4.3,2.4 etc 
         iii. By default it is considered as positive . Ex : 8.423 
         iv. Decimal part is present. Ex : 9.34,2.04,4.3 etc

      c. Character Constant
         i. Alphabet : 'A','Z','a','z' etc
         ii. Digit : '0','3','9' etc
         iii. Special symbols : '#', '$', '@' etc

2. Variable : 
   Variable is the name given to a memory location whose value may change during the execution of program. 
   
   Types of variables :
      i. Local variable : Whose scope is within function 
      ii. Global variable : Whose scope is throughout the program  

   Rules to define variable name : 
      i. Variable name cannot starts with a digit.
         int 1a; invalid
         int a1; valid

      ii. we can only use underscore and asterisk operator(to define pointer variable) to define variable.
         int a_b; valid
         int *p; valid (pointer variable)
         int a*b; invalid

      iii. we use comma operator to seperate two variables
         int a  b; invalid 
         int a,b; valid 
         int a#b; invalid

3. Keywords : 
Keywords are reserved words, whose meaning is already defined. we cannot use keywords as a variable name. There are 32 keywords in C language.
Ex : for, while, auto, extern, case, default, register, static  etc

4. Identifier : 
Identifier means Userdefined names
   i. Here we use uppercase to define constants. Ex : const int MAX = 100 
   ii. Here we use lowercase to define variables. Ex : int x = 200;
   iii. Here we use camel case to define function name. Ex : addProduct

   some more cases : 
      Pascal case : Demo 
      Snake case : add_product 
      Habib case : add-product

5. Seperators : 
      , comma
      ; semi-colon
      {} curly brackets
      () parenthesis 
      [] square brackets

6. Operator : 
Operators are the symbols which are used to perform some operations on one or more than one operand(variable and constant).
              x + y
              5 + 7
              x + 8
   Types of Operators : 
      a. Assignment Operator (=)
      Assigns right hand side value to left hand side variable 
      int a = 100;
      here 100 is value
      a is variable
      = is assignment operator

      b. Arithmetic Operator
      Performs Arithmetic operations
      ----------------------------------------------
      Symbol      Name         Functionality A=5,B=2
      ----------------------------------------------
      +          Addition        A + B = 5 + 2 = 7
      -          Subtraction     A - B = 5 - 2 = 3
      *          Multiplication  A * B = 5 * 2 = 10
      /          Division        A / B = 5 / 2 = 2
      %          Modulus         A % B = 5 % 2 = 1
      ----------------------------------------------

      input    input    output
      --------------------------
      int      int      int
      5     /   2    =   2

      float    int      float
      5.0   /   2    =   2.5

      int     float     float
      5     /  2.0    =  2.5

      float   float      float
      5.0   /  2.0    =  2.5

      a = 5, b = 2
      a/b.0 invalid 

      (float)a/b valid 
      here (float)a is considered as type casting
      5.0/2 = 2.5

      c. Relational operator
                                             a = 5, b = 2
         <     less than                     a < b = 5 < 2 = 0 
         >     greter than                   a > b = 5 > 2 = 1
         <=    less than or equals to        a <= b = 5 <= 2 = 0
         >=    greater than or equals to     a >= b = 5 >= 2 = 1
         ==    double equals to              a == b = 5 == 2 = 0
         !=    not equals to                 a != b = 5 != 2 = 1

      d. Arithmetic Assignment Operator 
         or Compound Operator 
         or Shorthand Operator

         +=   -=   *=   /=   %=

         a = a + 10 ------------> a += 10
         a = a - 10 ------------> a -= 10
         a = a * 10 ------------> a *= 10
         a = a / 10 ------------> a /= 10
         a = a % 10 ------------> a %= 10         

      e. Conditional operator ( ? : )
      ( condition ) ? expression 1 : expression 2 ;
          |  |______true_____|              |  
          |_____________________false_______|

      ( a > b ) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater" ;
          
      (condition) ? ( cond ? exp1 : exp2 ) : ( cond ? exp1 : exp2 ) ;

      (a>b) ? (a>c ? "a is greater" : "c is greater") : (b>c ? "b is greater" : "c is greater");

// Datatypes in C - covered from slides
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of C Program : 
------------------------

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main(){
    clrscr();
    printf("Hello world");  
    getch();
}

or

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello world");  
    return 0;
}

--------------------------------------------------

step 1 : Documentation part 
         // Program to print Hello World
         // Hello world program 
         // program to print Hello World

         Single line comment 
         //

         multiple line comment
         /*
              .....
              .....
         */

step 2 : Header Files 
       #include<stdio.h> 
       #include<conio.h>
       #include<stdlib.h>
       #include<math.h>
       #include<string.h> etc 

       #include<stdio.h>
       
       # = preprocessor symbol or preprocessor operator 
       include = file inclusion directive 
       #include = preprocessor directive

       Preprocessor : Preprocessor simply gives instructions to the compiler to pre process the information before actual compilation starts. 

       <> = tags

       stdio.h = standard input output . h
                 here .h is the extension of header file
       conio.h = console input output .h 
       stdlib.h = standard library .h

step 3 : int main() | void main() | _____ main()
                                     int 

      here int , void are the return types
      where int returns integer value
      and void represents that the specific function does not return any value.

step 4 : {    represents opening of main function definition part 
step 5 : clrscr(); performs cleaning action (clears the output terminal)
step 6 : printf(); performs printing operation
                   here f represents formatted function, which means it can contains format specifier.
step 7 : getch(); | return 0; 
         here getch() means get a character
         getch() simply holds the output screen 
         getche() it represents by which character we terminate output screen

         return 0; it simply returns 0

step 8 : } it represents closing of main function definition part.
