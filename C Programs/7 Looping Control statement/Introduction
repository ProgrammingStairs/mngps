Looping control statement
-------------------------
Looping is the process of performing same task or some task in an iterative or repetative manner untill certain condition is satisfied.

Types of Loops : 
    a. Entry Control Loop
    b. Exit control loop 

a. Entry Control Loop
   In case of entry control loop, condition is checked at the time of entry.Here we use for loop and while loop.

b. Exit Control loop 
   In case of exit control loop, condition is checked at the time of exit.Here we use do while loop.

   Difference between for loop, while loop and do while loop : 

   for loop : When we already know in advance that how many times we have to executes our loop. Ex: table of a number 

   while loop : When we don't know in advance that how many times we have to executes our loop. Ex : reversing a number

   do while loop : Whether condition is true or false, do while loop may executes atleast once.
