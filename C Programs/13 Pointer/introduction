Pointer
--------

1. Pointer is a derived datatype 
2. Pointer is a variable which can hold the address of another same type of variable
   int a = 100;
   int b = a; 
   value of b = 100

   int *b;
   b = &a;
   *b = *(&a) = value at (address of a)

3. For making any variable as a pointer variable, we need to put asterisk sign followed by variable name.
4. Size of pointer variable is dependent upon compiler and system architecture
5. Its not mandatory to initialize pointer variable when declared.
   int *ptr;
6. We can also initialize pointer variable by null.
   int *ptr=NULL;
7. Pointer variable can be categorized as void pointer, null pointer, wild pointer etc
8. There are two operator which we use in pointer : 
    a. & ampersand operator (address of operator)
    b. * asterisk operator (value at operator)
