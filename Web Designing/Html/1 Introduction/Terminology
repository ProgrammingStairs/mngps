1. HTML : 
   1. Full form of HTML is Hyper text markup language
   Here language acts as a medium of communication
   Here Hypertext means A text which contains link to another text 
   Here Markup Language means Tag(<>) based language
   Here Markup language works on three terminology : 
    a. Definition
    b. Processing 
    c. Presentation
    2. Html document contains multimedia content (animation,images,audio,video, transition,transformation etc)
    3. We need to save html document by .html extension.
    4. Output of Html document is going to be displayed out on browser screen.
    5. Html works on Tags(<>).
    6. Currently HTML5 is going in the market.
    7. Html is maily used to create structure of your web page(or web application).
    8. Html was developed by TIM BERNERS LEE, who was CERN Researcher and he used html for sharing documents with his co-workers, but later on in 1991, he decided to brought html in web designing with few tags.
    9. Html works on three terminology : 
        a. Tag 
        b. Attribute 
        c. Element

    a) Tag : Tags are hidden keywords, which are mainly used to display content on output screen.
        Types of Tags :
            i. Empty tag (unbalanced tag)
               Which only have opening and no closing 
               ex: <hr>,<br>,<input>,<img> etc 

            ii. Container tag (balanced tag)
               Which have opening and closing both
               ex: <html>...</html>,<body>...</body> etc

            iii. Semantic tag
                Tags which shows there meaning by there name
                ex: <header>..</header>, <footer>..</footer> etc 

            iv. Non-Semantic Tag or Structural tag
                Tags which shows generalized meaning
                ex: <form>...</form>,<table>..</table> etc    

            v. Self closing Tag (React)
                ex: <br/> <hr/> <input/> etc  
    
    b) Attribute : Attribute provides some additional information
        <p>This is an example of paragraph</p> 
        output : This is an example of paragraph

        <p align="center">This is an example of paragraph</p> 
        output :             This is an example of paragraph

        <img src="" height="" width="" alt="">
        <input type="text" placeholder="">

        here align, src, height, width, alt, type, placeholder all thses are attributes which shows some additional information 

    c) Element : HTML is an element, which represents whole document and it comprises of opening of <html> tag and closing of </html> tag. Similarly, BODY is also an element, which represents documents body and it comprises of opening of <body> tag and closing of </body> tag.

    Structure of HTML
    ----------------- 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>....</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            ......
            ......
        </body>
    </html>


here     <!DOCTYPE html>
         <! = MDO (Markup Declaration Open)
         DOCTYPE = Documentation Type 
         Here Doctype simply represents that which type of documentation browser needs to expect  from this specific document. 
         here html is type of document

         <html> = it represents whole document
            <head> = it represents head section 
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                here meta means data about data
                charset means character set, which means here it consider each character by Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit (1 byte)

                <meta name="viewport" content=".......">

                <title> title represents tab heading 
            </head>
            <body> = it represents documents body
                .....
                .....
            </body>
        </html>

        save : filename.html
        output : Browser screen
