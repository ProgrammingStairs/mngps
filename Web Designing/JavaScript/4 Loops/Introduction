Looping Control statement
-------------------------
Looping is the process of performing same task or some task in an iterative manner untill certain condition is satisfied. 

Types of loops : 
    a. Entry control loop
        Where condition is checked at the time of entry
        For ex : for loop  and while loop

        for loop : When we already know in advance that how many times we have to execute our loop. For ex : Printing a table of a number

        while loop : When we don't know in advance that how many times we have to execute out loop. For ex : Reversing a number

    b. Exit control loop 
        Where condition is checked at the time of exit
        For ex : do while loop 

        do while loop : Whether condition is true or false, do while loop may executes atleast once.
